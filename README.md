**This is a complete solution for sending and receiving dmx-data via Art-Net without the need of additional hardware**

## Credits
[Art-Netâ„¢](https://art-net.org.uk/) is a trademark of Artistic Licence Engineering Ltd.

This work is basend on the [node-red-contrib-artnet](https://github.com/gunnebo-ab/node-red-contrib-artnet) nodes developed by [Gunnebo](http://www.gunnebo.com/)

The Art-Net library is taken from [margau/dmxnet](https://github.com/margau/dmxnet)

Added the features introduced by [node-red-contrib-artnet-plus](https://github.com/haydendonald/node-red-contrib-artnet) by [Hayden Donald](https://github.com/haydendonald)

## Main changes to the previous work

- Basically it is fully compatible to the payload format defined by gunnebo
- More than one universe can now be served
- Transitions got more attributes and features
- This module is fully functional without any additional hardware
- The sending is completely rewritten, so that you can't flood the artnet
- The transition engine is rewritten, so that only one interval timer with the required resolution ist doing the transition handling.

## Install

Run the following command in the root directory of your Node-RED install. Usually this is `~/.node-red`
```
npm install @bannsaenger/node-red-contrib-artnet-controller
```
Or even inside of Node-RED with the palette manager.

## Using

### Sending DMX-Data

First you must specify a **Art-Net controller** configuration node. The controller is bound to one or all 
ip addresses found on the system and handles the Art-Net polling and shows up as an Art-Net node in the network.

For sending data there must be a **Art-Net Sender** configuration node. This node holds one universe of dmx-data
and hadles the sending of this universe to the network.

To get dmx-data out to the network you use the **Art-Net Out** node. This is basically connected to
a **Art-Net Sender** node. If you mass am msg object without additional addressing, the dmx values
are sent to the **Art-Net Sender** specified in the **Art-Net Out** node.

If you pass additional addressing information, the **Art-Net Out** node tries to find a sender with the given
address information. If none is found the configured **Art-Net Sender** instance is taken.

```
msg.payload = {
  "net": 0,
  "subnet": 0,
  "universe": 1
```
- `net` - int: net in [0, 127]
- `subnet` - int: subnet in [0, 15]
- `universe` - int: universe in [0, 15]

### Receiving DMX-Data

With the **Art-Net In** node you can receive dmx values. Each **Art-Net In** node must be bound to a existing **Art-Net controller** configuration node.
You must specify a net, subnet and universe. Then the data can be received in form of
buckets as decribed in **Payload format** later in this document or as a Uint8Array with the values of the whole universe.  

### Payload format

You can either set a single channel like the following example:

```
msg.payload = {
  "channel": 1,
  "value": 255 
};
```
- `channel` - int: address in [1, 512]
- `value` - int: value in [0, 255]

Or you can set multiple channels at once:

```
msg.payload = {
  "buckets": [
    {"channel": 1, "value": 255},
    {"channel": 4, "value": 0}
  ]
};
```

You can also fade to values, either for a single channel or multiple channels. You should specify the 'transition', a 'duration' in milliseconds and optional a
number of repetitions. The value of -1 in 'repeat', forces the the transition to run infinitely till a value or other transtion is send on this channel.
If a repetition is defined, a gap between repetitions can be defined. The transition ends with the target value, holds and starts again with the value before the transition.

```
msg.payload = {
    "transition": "linear",
    "duration": 5000,
    "repeat": 1,
    "gap": 1000,
    "buckets": [
      {"channel": 1, "value": 255},
      {"channel": 4, "value": 0}
    ]
}
```
- `channel` - int: address in [1, 512]
- `value` - int: value in [0, 255]

Optional you can define start values. These will not be sent immediately. Can also be specified in the trasition payload as well.

```
msg.payload = {
    "start_buckets": [
        {"channel": 1, "value": 255},
        {"channel": 4, "value": 123},
    ]
};
```

In order to perform arc transition (movement by arc) you shold specify more details:

```
msg.payload = {
    "transition": "arc",
    "duration": 2000,
    "arc": {
        "pan_channel": 1,
        "tilt_channel": 3,
        "pan_angle": 540,
        "tilt_angle": 255
    },
    "start": {"pan": 0, "tilt": 44},
    "center": {"pan": 127.5, "tilt": 63.75},
    "end": {"pan": 85, "tilt": 44}
};
```
where

- `arc` - channels that should be involved in arc transition (pan and tilt channels)
- `start` - initial channel's values (start point). By default: current channel's values.
- `center` - "center point" values
- `end` - terminal channel's values (end point)

In example above moving head will move by arc starting from {pan: 0, tilt: 44} to {pan: 85, tilt: 44}. Center point ({pan: 127.5, tilt: 63.75}) defines nominal circle center.

The 'repeat' value can also be added in this transition.

## Attention using the arc feature
This "arc" feature behaves exact like the original module. But the description does not meet the reality. The start, center and end points are not realy channel values.
Must be revised.
