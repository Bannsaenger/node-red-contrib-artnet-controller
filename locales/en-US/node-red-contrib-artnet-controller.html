    <p>Send DMX Data to a Art-Net Sender Instance.</p>
    <p>This node is used to send DMX data to a Art-Net Sender Instance.</p>
    <p>It must be connected to a valid sender instance.</p>
    <p>In general the data received by this node will be passed to the configured sender instance. If there is some address information in the received data 
        it depends on the setting of the <code>Ignore Address</code> checkbox how the further processing will be done.

    <h4>In the <code>payload</code> object there can be the following data:</h4>
    <h4>A single channel</h4>
<pre>
msg.payload = {
    "channel": 1,
    "value": 255
};
</pre>
<h4>Or you can set multiple channels at once</h4>
<pre>
msg.payload = {
    "buckets": [
        {"channel": 1, "value": 255},
        {"channel": 4, "value": 0},
    ]
};
</pre>
<h4>You can also fade to values, either for a single channel or multiple channels. You should specify the 'transition', a 'duration' in milliseconds and optional a number of repetitions. 
    The value of -1 in 'repeat', forces the the transition to run infinitely till a value or other transtion is send on this channel.
    If a repetition is defined, a gap between repetitions can be defined. The transition ends with the target value, holds and starts again with the value before the transition.
</h4>
<pre>
msg.payload = {
    "transition": "linear",
    "duration": 5000,
    "repeat": 1,
    "gap": 1000,
    "buckets": [
        {"channel": 1, "value": 255},
        {"channel": 4, "value": 0},
    ]
}
</pre>
<h4>Optional you can define start values. These will not be sent immediately. Can also be specified in the trasition payload as well.</h4>
<pre>
    msg.payload = {
        "start_buckets": [
            {"channel": 1, "value": 255},
            {"channel": 4, "value": 123},
        ]
    };
</pre>
<h4>In order to perform arc transition (movement by arc) you shold specify more details</h4>
<pre>
msg.payload = {
    "transition": "arc",
    "duration": 2000,
    "arc": {
        "pan_channel": 1,
        "tilt_channel": 3,
        "pan_angle": 540,
        "tilt_angle": 255
    },
    "start": {"pan": 0, "tilt": 44},
    "center": {"pan": 127.5, "tilt": 63.75},
    "end": {"pan": 85, "tilt": 44}
};
</pre>
    <p>whereby</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>arc</code> - channels that should be involved in arc transition (pan and tilt channels)</li>
        <li><code>start</code> - initial channel's values (start point). By default: current channel's values</li>
        <li><code>center</code> - "center point" values</li>
        <li><code>end</code> - terminal channel's values (end point)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In example above moving head will move by arc starting from {pan: 0, tilt: 44} to {pan: 85, tilt: 44}. Center point ({pan: 127.5, tilt: 63.75}) defines nominal circle center.
        The 'repeat' value can also be added in this transition.
    </p>
    <h3>Details</h3>
    <h4>Ignore Address</h4>
    <p>When checked all address information from the <code>msg</code> object will be ignored. Otherwise an attempt is made to find a matching universe inside this controller. 
        If there is no matching universe the data is sent to the configured sender.</p>

    <p>receive DMX Data</p>
    <p>The receivers listens to a specified universe and forwards the received data.</p>
    <p>It must be connetcted to a valid controller instance.</p>
    <h3>Details</h3>
    <h4>Net, Subnet and Universe</h4>
    <p>These three values specifies the complete universe address. There is a theoretical maximum of 32.768 universes which can be handeled
        by Art-Net. Only 255 universes can be propagated through Art-Poll. The address parts have the folloing limits:
        <ul>
            <li>Net: <code>a number 0-127</code></li>
            <li>SubNet: <code>a number 0-15</code></li>
            <li>Universe: <code>a number 0-15</code></li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h4>Format and forwarding</h4>
    <p>Either "Buckets" or "Universe as Uint8Array" can be selected as out format. 
        In the case of "Buckets" an array with 512 values will be transmitted each time an ArtDMX packet is received, depending on the "Changes only" switch, 
        or only the changed channels. 
        In the case of "Universe as Uint8Array" the entire universe is always transferred, but depending on the "Only changes" switch either with each ArtDMX packet or only if at least one value has changed.

<script type="text/html" data-help-name="Art-Net Sender">
    <p>Configuration for a Art-Net Sender Instance.</p>
    <p>The sender holds one universe of ArtDmx data and has the complete functionality
        to manipulate the DMX values.</p>
    <p>It must be connected to a valid controller instance.</p>
    <h3>Details</h3>
    <h4>IP address</h4>
    <p>The address to send to. In default it is the <b>limited broadcast</b> (255.255.255.255), but can be all forms of broadcast (local or directed)
        or any other valid unicast address. Like in the Art-Net specification the limited broadcast should not be used for production environments.
        If possible use the directed broadcast.
        <b>Be careful in Windows enviroments</b> In Windows the limited broadcast will be sent only to the first network adpater. 
        On multihomed systems the directed broadcast should be used.</p>
    <h4>Port</h4>
    <p>The Port at this point is the port where Art-Net data will be sent to. In general it is the same port as set in the controller instance.</p>
    <h4>Net, Subnet and Universe</h4>
    <p>These three values specifies the complete universe address. There is a theoretical maximum of 32.768 universes which can be handeled
        by Art-Net. Only 255 universes can be propagated through Art-Poll. The address parts have the folloing limits:
        <ul>
            <li>Net: <code>a number 0-127</code></li>
            <li>SubNet: <code>a number 0-15</code></li>
            <li>Universe: <code>a number 0-15</code></li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h4>MaxRate</h4>
    <p>Maximum amount of ArtDMX frames to send (default 10). If values arrive in a higher frequency the spontaneous sending will be delayed.
        Range: 0 - 50
        With value 0 wthe spontaneous sending will be deactivated. So the transmission of ArtDMX frames will only be controlled via the value <b>Refresh</b>. 
    </p>
    <h4>Refresh</h4>
    <p>This value is in <b>ms</b> (default 1000). After this interval the Art-Dmx data will be resend regardless of whether the data has been changed. 
        Range: 20 - 100.000 ms
        If any Art-Dmx value is changed the data will be sent immediatly dependig of the value of MaxRate.
        <b>Caution: This value must be higher than the time defined by MaxRate. Don't care if MaxRate is 0</b>",
    </p>
    <h4>Save values</h4>
    <p>When checked all DMX values are saved to context on close. So the DMX values are immediatly available after deploy.</p>

    <h3>Details</h3>
    <h4>IP address</h4>
    <p>The IP Address List contains all IP Addresses found on the server.
       <b>Attention</b> when selecting the 0.0.0.0 entry (bind to all addresses). 
       Only one controller can be bound to a IP address.</p>
    <h4>Port</h4>
    <p>The listening Port for receiving Art-Net packets. 
        The default value should not be changed but can be adjusted to a specific environment.</p>
    <h4>OEM-Code</h4>
    <p>The OEM-Code identifies the manufacturer of the Controllers. You can choose the original
        manufacturer eg. author of the module (margau) the default manufacturer (Artistic License)
        as well as every four digit hex value.</p>
    <h4>Short and long name</h4>
    <p>Choose a short an a long name which are published by the controller as identification via Art-Poll</p>
    <h4>Debug level</h4>
    <p>The debug level can be used to turn on debugging to the console.
       Warnings and errors are also sent to the debug window in the Node-RED editor.</p>
